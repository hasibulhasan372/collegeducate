TigerBlog is borrowing that today as he writes about three separate baseball-related subjects, two of which relate to Princeton: Do you know how many active Major League Baseball players have at least 2,000 career hits?  The answer is not a lot. Actually, it's six. That's it.The idea that a pitcher will reach 300 wins in these days of pitch counts and limited innings is pretty much out the window. If anything, a relief pitcher has as good a chance of getting to 300 wins as a starter, and maybe even better. But 3,000 hits? Maybe it's because of how many at-bats now end in either home runs or strikeouts, but players don't seem to be piling up the number of hits that they used to."
